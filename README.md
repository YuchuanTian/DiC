**_ConvUNets have been overlooked... but they outperform Diffusion Transformers!_**

## News

3/3/2025: Codes & Weights are at the final stage of inspection. We will have them released ASAP.

2/27/2025: DiC is accepted by CVPR 2025! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

ðŸ¤” In this work, we intend to build a diffusion model with Conv3x3 that is simple but efficient.

ðŸ”§ We re-design architectures & blocks of the model to tap the potential of Conv3x3 to the full.

ðŸš€ The proposed DiC ConvUNets are more powerful than DiTs, and **much much faster**!


## Codes

Codes and Weights will be released. Please keep tuned!
